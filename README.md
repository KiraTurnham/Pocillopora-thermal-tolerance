# <i> Pocillopora</i> thermal tolerance

Repository of analysis and figure-generating code for the paper submitted for consideration: "Minimal trade-offs in physiological function for corals with thermally tolerant, host-adapted symbionts" Kira E. Turnham, Matthew D. Aschaffenburg, D. Tye Pettay, David Paz Garcia, Héctor Reyes-Bonilla, Jorge Pinzón, Ellie Timmins, Robin T. Smith, Michael P. McGinley, Mark E. Warner, Todd C. LaJeunesse. 

The following code was used in investigating the functional performance of <i> Pocillopora grandis</i>  in La Paz, Mexico with symbionts <i> Durusdinium glynnii</i> or <i> Cladocopium latusorum</i>.  Details of measurements are provided in paper, and all raw data is available in Dryad at the following link: https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.dr7sqvb2t

(DOI will be provided when available)

## Files overview ##

Abundance <- three independent sampling efforts to estimate the abundance of P. grandis colonies housing C. latusorum, D. glynnii, or both (biodiversity survey in 2004, transect establishment and sampling in 2006, and polar/circular plot sampling in 2009).

Symbiont_size_dens_vol<- symbiont cell densities per host area, cell sizes, and total volume of symbiont to host. 

MI <- Analysis code for comparing daily, seasonal, and experimental symbiont mitotic indices

Fecundity <- Analysis code for comparing host relative fecundity (oocyte size and number, spermary number, per polyp)

Growth <- Analysis code for comparing host calcification, buoyant weight, and linear extension

Calyx <- Analysis code for comparing host calyx dimensions

FIRe <- Analysis code for comparing photophysiology during heat experiment measured with FIRe.
