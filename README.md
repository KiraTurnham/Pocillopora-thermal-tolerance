# <i> Pocillopora</i> -trade-offs

Repository of analysis and figure-generating code for the paper "Minimal trade-offs in physiological function for corals with thermally tolerant, host-adapted symbionts" Kira E. Turnham, Matthew D. Aschaffenburg, D. Tye Pettay, David Paz Garcia, Héctor Reyes-Bonilla, Jorge Pinzón, Ellie Timmins, Robin T. Smith, Michael P. McGinley, Mark E. Warner, Todd C. LaJeunesse. 

The following code was used in investigating the functional performance of <i> Pocillopora grandis</i>  in La Paz, Mexico with symbionts <i>Durusdinium glynnii<i> or <i>Cladocopium latusorum<i>.  Details of measurements and raw datasets are provided in the supplemental material in the paper.
